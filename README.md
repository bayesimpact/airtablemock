# Airtable Mock

A mock library to help test Python code accessing Airtable using the [Python library](https://github.com/nicocanali/airtable-python).

It keeps tables in RAM and can do basic operations.

## Installation

The easiest way is using pip:

```sh
pip install airtablemock
```

## Usage

In your test, you patch the whole airtable library:

```py
import unittest

import airtablemock

import mycode


@airtablemock.patch(mycode.__name__ + '.airtable')
class TestMyCode(unittest.TestCase):

  def test_foo():
    # This is a client for the base "baseID", it will not access the real
    # Airtable service but only the mock one which keeps data in RAM.
    client = airtablemock.Airtable('baseID', 'apiKey')

    # Populate the table.
    client.create('table-foo', {'field1': 1, 'field2': 'two'})

    # Run your code that uses Airtable, it should transparently uses the table
    # above.
    mycode.run()

    # Access the table again to check if anything was modified.
    records = client.get('table-foo')
    â€¦
```

## Release

To create a new release of airtablemock, update the version number in
`setup.py`, tag the Git repo and run:

```sh
